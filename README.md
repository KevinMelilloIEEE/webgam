# webgam
These PHP pages along with GAM will allow you to use Apache for specific GAM purposes, protected by a basic username\password challenge.  I don't claim this is the best way to do it, or even a particularly good way to do it.  I claim it is a way to do it.  Call it a starting point!

## Proper Permissions of the User Folder where GAM is installed (for example /home/gamuser)
```
drwxr-xr-x  gamuser apache
chown gamuser:apache /home/gamuser
```
## Permissions for folder /home/gamuser/bin
```
dr-xr-xr-x  gamuser apache
```
## Permissions for folder /home/gamuser/bin/gam
```
drwxrwx---  gamuser apache
```
## Permissions for files inside GAM directory
```
-r--r--r--  gamuser apache  nobrowser.txt
-r--r--r--  gamuser apache  lastupdatecheck.txt
-r--r--r--  gamuser apache  oauth2service.json
-r--r--r--  gamuser apache  client_secrets.json
-rw-r--r--  gamuser apache  noupdatecheck.txt
-rw-r--r--  gamuser apache  whatsnew.txt
-rw-r--r--  gamuser apache  LICENSE
-rw-r--r--  gamuser apache  GamCommands.txt
-rwxr-x---  gamuser apache  gam
-rwxr-xr-x  gamuser apache  oauth2.txt.lock
-rw-rw-rw-  gamuser apache  oauth2.txt
```

Once these settings are set, then Apache should be able to call the /home/gamuser/bin/gam application and provide the results.
## index.php
This is the main file.  It loads header, main, and footer files.
## main.php
This is a basic menu, it only has a link to the email.php file.  You can add entries here if you need to have more commands available.
## login.php
This is the only real protection I have in this example.  This is what controls access to the site.  It uses a username\password option for access.  I am not sure how secure this is, and there are most likely better ways to be more secure.  But as a proof of concept, it's what I went with.  Do not depend on this being too secure, and use something better on an exposed 24/7 website.
## email.php
This is a basic form entry page that allows you to enter an email address which will be passed to functions.php for resolution.
## functions.php
This is where GAM is called, and the results are retrieved, and shown to the user.  At this time, it checks the email address to determine if it is a user or group.  If it is a user, it returns the vacation responder as well as any delegates on the account.  If it is a group, it returns the managers, and members.
